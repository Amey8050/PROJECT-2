# PROJECT-2
 Jarvis Voice Assistant

This project is a voice-activated virtual assistant named "Jarvis" that responds to voice commands. It can open specific websites like Google, Facebook, YouTube, and LinkedIn, or fetch and read aloud the latest business news headlines. The assistant is activated by the keyword "Jarvis," followed by the command.

To get started, you need Python 3.6 or above installed on your system. After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies, which include SpeechRecognition for capturing and processing voice commands, pyttsx3 for text-to-speech functionality, requests for making HTTP requests (especially for retrieving news), and webbrowser for opening specified websites. You can install these packages using pip by running pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 requests.

To use the News API for fetching news headlines, youâ€™ll need to create an account on News API and obtain an API key. Once you have the key, replace newsapi = "" in the code with your key. This enables the assistant to fetch and read the latest business news.

To run the program, execute python jarvis.py. The assistant will initialize with the message "Initializing Jarvis..." and will begin listening for the keyword "Jarvis." Once activated, you can give commands like "Open Google," "Open Facebook," "Open YouTube," "Open LinkedIn," or simply "News" to hear the latest business news headlines.

If you encounter any errors, check that your microphone is accessible, and ensure your News API key is correctly configured. If news retrieval fails, verify that your key is active and has the necessary permissions. Additionally, refer to any console error messages for further troubleshooting.
